# Base sample set configuration
#
# Developers can add configuration items to be used for a given sample
# project. This is primarily to help add authentication information,
# allow various sample projects to be published to a given Confluence
# instance (without having to copy/paste authentication across multiple
# sample `conf.py` files).
#
# (developer Git helper)
# git update-index --assume-unchanged tests/sample-sets/config.py

# (quick reference of common options)
# confluence_publish = True
# confluence_publish_token = ''
# confluence_server_pass = ''
# confluence_server_url = ''
# confluence_server_user = ''
# confluence_space_key = ''
