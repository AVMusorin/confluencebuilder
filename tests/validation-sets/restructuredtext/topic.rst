Topic
=====

reStructuredText defines a `topic directive`_. Example markup is as follows:

.. code-block:: none

    .. topic:: Topic Title

        Subsequent indented lines comprise
        the body of the topic, and are
        interpreted as body elements.

Output
------

.. topic:: Topic Title

    Subsequent indented lines comprise
    the body of the topic, and are
    interpreted as body elements.
