Line block
==========

reStructuredText supports documents with `line blocks`_. Example markup
is as follows:

.. code-block:: none

    | Lend us a couple of bob till Thursday.
    | I'm absolutely skint.
    | But I'm expecting a postal order and I can pay you back
      as soon as it comes.
    | Love, Ewan.

Output
------

| Lend us a couple of bob till Thursday.
| I'm absolutely skint.
| But I'm expecting a postal order and I can pay you back
  as soon as it comes.
| Love, Ewan.
