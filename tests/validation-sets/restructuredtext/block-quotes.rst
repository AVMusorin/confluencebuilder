Block Quotes
============

reStructuredText defines a `block quote`, a text block that is indented
relative to the preceding text, without preceding markup indicating it
to be a literal block or other content. Example markup is as follows:

.. code-block:: none

        "It is my business to know things.  That is my trade."

        -- Sherlock Holmes

Output
------

    "It is my business to know things.  That is my trade."

    -- Sherlock Holmes
